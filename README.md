# GMTKJam2020
This game was made in two days for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2020.

The goal of the game is to approve a document in the company you work for, but the burocracy of it all makes this process insanely complicated.

Every step you make towards your goal changes your mouse movement in a different way.

*Programming Notes*

The biggest challenge of this project was the use of the cursor, as Unity is not very helpful in hindering or changing the control of the mouse during games.
The solution was to create a different object that acted like the cursor but could be changed when needed to add weird gameplay interactions.
This was also a project where I learned more about Coroutines, using them to play looping music tracks and sound effects and to move the doors of the elevator without stopping the rest of the game.
